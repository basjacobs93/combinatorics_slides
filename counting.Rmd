# Combinatorics

_Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics studying the **enumeration**, **combination**, and **permutation** of sets of elements and the mathematical relations that characterize their properties._<sup>1<sup>

# Shuffling cards

 - `cards`, `carsd`, ..., `arscd`

# Permutations

$n$ items can be reordered in $n! = n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot\ldots \cdot 2\cdot 1$ ways

$$ n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n$$

In how many ways can we draw 100 unique cards from 2000 possible cards?

--

$$2000\cdot 1999\cdot 1998\cdot \ldots \cdot 1901$$
--

$$= \frac{2000!}{1900!}$$

--
But the order does not matter!  

--
How many reorderings of these 100 cards are there? 
--
$100!$

--
$$ \frac{2000!}{1900!\cdot100!} = {2000 \choose 100} $$

# Combinations

Choosing $k$ objects from $n$ objects without repetition, order does not matter

# Example

# Calculating overlap

--

  1) Let shop A choose 100 cards: ${2000 \choose 100}$  
--

  2a) Overlap of 0: ${1900 \choose 100}$  
--
  
  2b) Overlap of 1: ${100\choose 1}\cdot{1900 \choose 99}$  
--
  
  2c) Overlap of $n$: ${100\choose n}\cdot{1900\choose 100-n}$  
--
  
  3) Number of ways of $n$ overlap: ${2000 \choose 100}\cdot{100\choose n}\cdot{1900 \choose 100-n}$  
--
  
  4) Probability of $n$ overlap: ${2000 \choose 100}\cdot{100\choose n}\cdot{1900 \choose 100-n} / {2000 \choose 100}{2000 \choose 100}$

---

```{python, eval=FALSE}
from math import factorial

def choose(n, k): 
    return factorial(n) // factorial(n-k) // factorial(k)
```

--

```{python, eval=FALSE}
probs = []
for overlap in range(100):
    probs.append(
        choose(100, overlap) * choose(1900, 100-overlap) /
        choose(2000, 100)
    )

# Sending cards

  - 10 cards 
  - 3 friends to send cards to
  - Every friend should receive at least 1 card
  - In how many ways can we send cards to friends?

---

# Stars and bars

  - Denote every card with a star ★
--
    
  - Put them in a row  
  
★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
  
--

  - Place two bars between the stars  

★ ★ ★|★ ★ ★ ★ ★|★ ★

  
--
    
  ${9 \choose 2} = 36$ ways of sending cards

# Bootstrapping

In how many different ways can we select (with replacement) $n$ observations from a dataset of $n$ observations, where order doesn't matter?

---

# Bootstrapping: example
                                                                                    
In how many different ways can we select (with replacement) 10 observations from a dataset of 10 observations, where order doesn't matter?

--
  
 | ★ ★ | | | ★ ★ ★ | ★ | ★ ★ | | | ★ ★
--
  
  
  
[0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2]

---

# Bootstrapping: in general

  - $n$ stars (observations)
  - $n-1$ bars (we draw $n$ observations)
$${n + (n-1) \choose n} = {2n-1 \choose n}$$

For 10 observations, 92378 possible samples!
